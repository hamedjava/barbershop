  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: iranSans
       fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/iranSans/iran_bold.ttf
            weight: 700
          - asset:  assets/fonts/iranSans/iran.ttf
            weight: 300
            
  #     - family: Trajan Pro
  #       fonts:
  #         - asset: fonts/muli.light.ttf
  #         - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #           weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
